#Strike - Node.js dev runner
This is a simple Node.js webserver, that deploys a single page web-ui.
It is used to control another Node.js script.
It can restart the script, show the output of the script live, and change the script it is running.

I have used it on a tablet besides my development machine, 
and for developing using a tablet.
